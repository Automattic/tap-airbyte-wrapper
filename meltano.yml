            It can be gleaned by running the tap with the `--about` flag and the `--config` flag
            pointing to a file containing the `airbyte_spec` configuration.

            Disables the check for natively executable sources. By default, AirByte sources are checked
            to see if they are able to be executed natively without using containers. This disables that
            check and forces them to run in containers.
